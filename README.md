# jparse
__**a small and simple wrapper for managing .json files**__

## Why?

- I was pretty bored, wanted to do something
- I was annoyed with the hassle of managing json-based files
- Because why not

## Usage

run `go get github.com/csharpdf/jparse` in your console, and then import it into your project:

```go
import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/csharpdf/jparse"
)
```
Then you're ready to start using it!

Of course, there's more than just that, so make sure to check out the [docs](https://github.com/csharpdf/jparse/wiki) for more info!
